  "articleBody": "As a writer eager to publish articles and thought pieces, you might be considering platforms like Medium and Substack. These two popular sites offer distinct pathways for content creators, each with its unique advantages.\nMedium is often seen as more beginner-friendly, offering a built-in audience and an easy start for new writers.\nOn the other hand, Substack provides a straightforward, free setup with the potential for subscription-based income, making it an attractive option for those looking to monetize their audience.\nLet’s dive deeper into the differences and find out which platform suits your writing journey best.\nSubstack vs. Medium at a Glance Feature Medium Substack Founded 2012 2017 Target Independent authors and writers Columnists, Journalists, political commentators Revenue Offers readers a $5 monthly membership. Charges a 10% fee on subscriptions charged by writers to their audience. Monetization Earnings generated from the Medium Partner Program. Offering a subscription-based newsletter to your readers. Medium Medium external link is a platform that allows anyone to share their essays without requiring a personal website, and it is open-source.\nMedium provides aspiring writers with an established readership, which can assist in growing your audience without the gradual process often associated with SEO.\nSubstack Substack external link is a digital platform that allows individuals to begin and grow a newsletter. Many writers are drawn to its features for paid newsletters, added social features, and coolness.\nIf your Substack newsletter doesn’t have engaging content that readers want to share, you’ll have to create a digital marketing plan to promote it when you begin writing.\nSimilarities between Medium and Substack Offer content for free or monetize it with exclusive member-only access. Both platforms promote your writing to their audiences, with Medium’s algorithm favoring new writers. Access detailed audience analytics on both. Readers can comment and share opinions on articles. Differences between Medium and Substack Monetization\nMedium:\nMonetization is based on the number of people who become premium members via your referral link and the time premium members spend reading your articles. Substack:\nYou earn revenue through paid subscriptions on a monthly or yearly basis, providing a more consistent income flow compared to Medium. Requirements for Monetization\nMedium:\nIn order to be monetized you need a minimum of one published article, a minimum of 100 followers, and have posted at least once within the last 6 months. Substack:\nNo requirements for you to get monetized (however, they take 10% of your subscription revenue) Features\nMedium:\nYou have the option to create or join publications. These are shared spaces for stories focused around a common theme, usually written by multiple writers. Substack:\nYou have control over your email list, giving you the ability to view and export individual emails, a feature that Medium lacks. Audience Reach\nMedium:\nMedium can be taken as a social media platform for writers. You may want to focus your attention there if you don’t have an established following yet. Substack:\nSubstack doesn’t provide an avenue for you to grow your audience, as only your subscribers can view your content due to its focus on email newsletters. Content Focus\nMedium:\nEmphasis is placed on producing a high volume of content that can quickly gain popularity. The platform’s algorithm often favors articles that can reach a broad audience through shares and engagement, rewarding writers who can capture immediate attention. Substack:\nEmphasis is placed on building a dedicated reader base through high-quality, thoughtful content. It prioritizes developing a loyal audience willing to subscribe and support the writer consistently. Platform Purpose\nMedium:\nIt acts as a launchpad for writers seeking exposure. It’s ideal for reaching a large audience quickly and is useful for testing ideas and gaining initial traction in the writing community. Substack:\nServes as a destination for writers looking to monetize their work directly. It’s great for building a sustainable writing career by developing a subscription-based revenue model. Engagement\nMedium:\nEncourages experimentation by allowing writers to publish a variety of content types and styles. The platform supports diverse topics and writing forms, making it a good place for writers to explore different ideas. Substack:\nDemands commitment from writers who aim to build and maintain a subscriber base. Consistent publishing and engagement are crucial for retaining subscribers and growing readership. Goals\nExposure:\nMedium is the better choice for writers looking to gain visibility and reach a wide audience quickly. Income:\nSubstack is more suited for writers who want to generate income through subscriptions and are willing to invest in building a loyal readership. Community and Impact:\nSubstack fosters community through direct communication with subscribers, while either platform can have an impact, depending on how it aligns with your objectives.\nMedium can also build community through its network of writers and readers, though Substack provides a more personal connection. Conclusion Medium and Substack both have their pros and cons that the other does not possess. To maximize productivity, it is important to customize your writing approach according to these strengths and limitations.\nI will stress that the most effective way to decide is by experimenting with these platforms personally. While I have attempted to provide helpful information in this article, I have not taken into account your personal experience, viewpoint, and objectives. No other author who writes about this topic can do so.\nFrequently Asked Questions Are Medium and Substack the same?\nSubstack enables freelance writers to utilize paid subscription features. Nevertheless, Medium offers a wider audience, improved visibility, and instant earning potential.\nWhat is the downside of Substack?\nSubstack can become costly. If you choose to make money from your Substack, 10% will be deducted by them and an extra 3% will be taken by Stripe, totaling 13% of your earnings automatically deducted. This could cost more than the typical monthly newsletter subscription services.\nWhat is Medium best used for?\nMedium is a platform where individuals have access to significant, thought-provoking stories about their interests and can also exchange ideas with a global audience.\n",

 is a digital platform that allows individuals to begin and grow a newsletter. Many writers are drawn to its features for paid newsletters, added social features, and coolness.</p>
<p>If your Substack newsletter doesn&rsquo;t have engaging content that readers want to share, you&rsquo;ll have to create a digital marketing plan to promote it when you begin writing.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
Monetization is based on the number of people who become premium members via your referral link and the time premium members spend reading your articles.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
You earn revenue through paid subscriptions on a monthly or yearly basis, providing a more consistent income flow compared to Medium.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Requirements for Monetization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
In order to be monetized you need a minimum of one published article, a minimum of 100 followers, and have posted at least once within the last 6 months.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
No requirements for you to get monetized (however, they take 10% of your subscription revenue)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
You have the option to create or join publications. These are shared spaces for stories focused around a common theme, usually written by multiple writers.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
You have control over your email list, giving you the ability to view and export individual emails, a feature that Medium lacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audience Reach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
Medium can be taken as a social media platform for writers. You may want to focus your attention there if you don&rsquo;t have an established following yet.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
Substack doesn&rsquo;t provide an avenue for you to grow your audience, as only your subscribers can view your content due to its focus on email newsletters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
Emphasis is placed on producing a high volume of content that can quickly gain popularity. The platform’s algorithm often favors articles that can reach a broad audience through shares and engagement, rewarding writers who can capture immediate attention.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
Emphasis is placed on building a dedicated reader base through high-quality, thoughtful content. It prioritizes developing a loyal audience willing to subscribe and support the writer consistently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform Purpose</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
It acts as a launchpad for writers seeking exposure. It’s ideal for reaching a large audience quickly and is useful for testing ideas and gaining initial traction in the writing community.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
Serves as a destination for writers looking to monetize their work directly. It’s great for building a sustainable writing career by developing a subscription-based revenue model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>:<br>
Encourages experimentation by allowing writers to publish a variety of content types and styles. The platform supports diverse topics and writing forms, making it a good place for writers to explore different ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Substack</strong>:<br>
Demands commitment from writers who aim to build and maintain a subscriber base. Consistent publishing and engagement are crucial for retaining subscribers and growing readership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exposure</strong>:<br>
Medium is the better choice for writers looking to gain visibility and reach a wide audience quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong>:<br>
Substack is more suited for writers who want to generate income through subscriptions and are willing to invest in building a loyal readership.</li>
<li><strong>Community and Impact</strong>:<br>
Substack fosters community through direct communication with subscribers, while either platform can have an impact, depending on how it aligns with your objectives.<br>
Medium can also build community through its network of writers and readers, though Substack provides a more personal connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Medium and Substack both have their pros and cons that the other does not possess. To maximize productivity, it is important to customize your writing approach according to these strengths and limitations.</p>
<p>I will stress that the most effective way to decide is by experimenting with these platforms personally. While I have attempted to provide helpful information in this article, I have not taken into account your personal experience, viewpoint, and objectives. No other author who writes about this topic can do so.</p>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#frequently-asked-questions">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Are Medium and Substack the same?</strong><br>
Substack enables freelance writers to utilize paid subscription features. Nevertheless, Medium offers a wider audience, improved visibility, and instant earning potential.<br>
<br/></p>
<p><strong>What is the downside of Substack?</strong><br>
Substack can become costly. If you choose to make money from your Substack, 10% will be deducted by them and an extra 3% will be taken by Stripe, totaling 13% of your earnings automatically deducted. This could cost more than the typical monthly newsletter subscription services.<br>
<br/></p>
<p><strong>What is Medium best used for?</strong><br>
Medium is a platform where individuals have access to significant, thought-provoking stories about their interests and can also exchange ideas with a global audience.</p>
