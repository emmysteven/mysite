In 2020, the newletter industry was valued at $7.5 billion, and with the ongoing surge in newsletter popularity, choosing the right **newsletter platform** can make or break your growth. If you're starting or scaling a paid newsletter, **Beehiiv** and **Substack** are two of the most popular options.  

Each has its pros and cons, and depending on your goals, one might be a better fit than the other. This comparison covers everything from features and pricing to customization and monetization strategies.
<br/>

## What Is Substack?

### A Writer-First Platform with Built-in Discovery

[Substack](https://substack.com/@emmystevenx) is a platform built specifically for writers and content creators. It allows users to publish newsletters, build a following, and monetize through subscriptions.  

One of its core strengths is the built-in **network effect**. Readers often discover new newsletters via recommendations and the platform’s feed, which boosts discoverability.

However, Substack has started leaning into more algorithm-driven content like “Notes,” which can sometimes distract from your newsletter’s core purpose.
<br/>

## What Is Beehiiv?

### A Growth-Centric Newsletter Platform for Creators

[Beehiiv](https://beehiiv.com/) was founded by former Morning Brew team members and is designed to help creators **grow, scale, and monetize** newsletters.  

Unlike Substack, Beehiiv gives you more control over your audience. There’s no algorithm interfering with how or when your newsletter gets seen.  

You also get access to powerful tools like:

- Advanced audience analytics  
- Referral programs  
- Custom domains  
- Monetization via ads and sponsorships  
<br/>

## Pricing Breakdown

### Substack’s Revenue Share Model

Substack is free to use, but takes a 10% cut of any revenue you make from subscriptions. 

Let’s say you have 100 subscribers paying €5/month:  
- That’s €500 monthly revenue  
- Substack takes €50  
- Stripe fees also apply  

It’s a great model for creators who want no upfront costs but may become expensive as your revenue grows.

### Beehiiv’s Flat Pricing Model

Beehiiv starts free for up to 2,500 subscribers. Paid plans begin at **€49/month**, with no revenue share.

Let’s say you have 1,000 subscribers and 3% of them convert to a €5/month paid plan:  
- That’s €150 monthly revenue  
- You keep it all  
- You only pay the flat subscription fee  

For serious creators, Beehiiv is often more cost-effective in the long run.
<br/>

## Customization and Branding Control

### Substack: Minimalist but Limited

[Substack keeps things simple](/medium-vs-substack). The UI is clean and distraction-free, but it offers **limited customization**.  

If you want your newsletter to feel like a true extension of your brand, such as with custom domains, unique layouts, or integrations, Substack might not give you the flexibility you need.

### Beehiiv: Tailored to Your Brand

[Beehiiv shines](https://www.saaswrites.com/beehiiv-vs-substack) in terms of **customization and control**. You can:  
- Use a custom domain  
- Create branded landing pages  
- Embed referral forms  
- Access deeper data on audience behavior

It feels more like a full-fledged SaaS tool than just a writing platform.
<br/>

## Monetization Options: Substack vs Beehiiv

### Substack Focuses on Paid Subscriptions

Substack monetization is mostly about paid subscriptions. While it works, it’s not flexible.  

For example:  
- You can’t tease paid content to free readers  
- You can’t monetize via ads or sponsorships directly  
- There’s no built-in referral program

This can limit your ability to experiment with **diverse revenue streams**.

### Beehiiv Supports Multiple Monetization Strategies

Beehiiv supports:  
- **Paid subscriptions**  
- **Referral programs**  
- **Native ad network (Boost)**  
- **Audience segmentation for premium content**

This flexibility lets you build multiple income streams, test different strategies, and optimize for what works best with your audience.
<br/>

## Community and Support

### Substack: Simple Community, Limited Support

Substack offers comments, shares, and recommendations. It's more **writer-community centric** than technical. However, support is fairly limited and not personalized.

### Beehiiv: A Creator-Focused Ecosystem

Beehiiv gives creators access to a **private Slack group** filled with power users sharing growth tips and strategies.  

You also get access to active customer support, tutorials, and real-time feedback, which can be invaluable when scaling.
<br/>

## Who Should Use Which Platform?

### Substack Is Best When:

- You’re a writer focused on essays, opinion pieces, or personal narratives  
- You want a platform with **built-in discovery** and a minimal setup  
- You’re okay with giving up 10% of revenue for simplicity
<br/>

### Beehiiv Is Best When:

- You want to **grow and scale** a newsletter into a media business  
- You care about data, audience segmentation, and customization  
- You want **multiple monetization options** and long-term scalability  
<br/>

## Final Verdict

Both platforms are excellent, but serve **different types of creators**.

- If you're a writer who wants simplicity, Substack is would be great choice.
- If you're building a newsletter as a **business**, with branding, monetization, and growth in mind, **Beehiiv is the better long-term play**.

Whichever one you go with, ensure it aligns with your writing goals and how you plan to scale.
