## Woke Up to a Banned Account?

One morning, you wake up. You reach for your phone. You open Facebook or Instagram, and boom.

Your account is banned.

No warning, no explanation. Just a cold screen telling you your account has been disabled “due to a violation.” What violation? No clue.

You think: Was I hacked? Did I post something wrong? Was I reported?

Now what?

Most people do what feels logical: They panic. Then they carry out a Google search. They try to appeal blindly. Some even pay random agents on Instagram who claim they can “fix it.”

And then? No solution in sight. No response from Meta. No account recovery. Just them feeling frustrated, wasting money, and losing all their connections.

If this is your story or close to it, you’re not alone.

But here’s the truth: You that you can recover your banned account.

You just need the right process.

<br/>

## Why Your Appeals Get Ignored

Meta doesn’t offer customer support in the way most companies do. You don’t get a help desk. You get auto-responses or forms that are no longer working.

And when you don’t know the right forms to use, or how to phrase your appeal, you'll get ghosted.

Every day you stay locked out:

You lose connections

You miss out on DMs

You lose access to your content

If you’re a creator or business owner, you lose visibility and traction as well.

Truth be told. This doesn’t just affect your social media presence. It messes with your business, your communication, and your online presence.

So what’s the solution?

<br/>

## The Guide That Gets Your Account Back

I created a step-by-step guide to help people recover their banned personal Facebook or Instagram accounts, without paying scammers or wandering in the dark.

This isn’t guesswork. It’s the process that helped me (and others) get back in.

### Inside the guide, you’ll learn:

✅ Why your account was likely banned (even if you did nothing wrong)
✅ How to avoid making it worse with common mistakes
✅ Where to submit your appeal (with direct links that work)
✅ Exactly what to write in your appeal (templates included)
✅ How long to wait, and what to do if you don’t get a reply

This isn’t another vague ebook. It’s a clear recovery system.

Whether you lost your account for a mysterious “violation” or a login issue, this guide gives you the roadmap back in.

<br/>

## I’ve Been There Too

When my personal account was banned, I felt stuck. No one had clear answers. Everything I found online was either outdated, scammy, or vague.

So I went deep. I researched, tested, and documented everything. After finally recovering my account, I turned that into a guide so you don’t have to go through what I did.

Now, it’s helping others too.

You don’t need to be tech-savvy. You don’t need a big audience. And you definitely don’t need to pay $200 to some random scammer who sends you a WhatsApp number.

All you need is the right steps—and a little patience.

<br/>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long do Instagram bans last?**
Temporary suspensions usually last from 24 hours to 30 days, depending on how serious the violation is and whether it has happened before. In more serious or repeated cases, Instagram may choose to permanently disable the account.

<br/>

**How long does Facebook ban your account?**
Facebook temporary bans can last anywhere from a few hours to 30 days. The length of the restriction depends not only on how serious the violation is but also on how many times your account has been banned before. Typically, you’ll only receive a warning.

<br/>

**What happens if your Facebook account gets restricted?**
When your account is restricted or banned, you lose access to essential tools like Facebook Ads, the Facebook Pixel, Catalog Manager, and more. You won’t be able to run ads, track website performance, or manage any connected pages or accounts—all of which will also be affected by the restriction on your personal profile.
