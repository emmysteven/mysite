### Medium
![Medium | emmysteven.com](/img/01-medium-vs-substack.webp)
[Medium](https://medium.com) is a platform that allows anyone to share their essays without requiring a personal website, and it is open-source.

Medium provides aspiring writers with an established readership, which can assist in growing your audience without the gradual process often associated with SEO.

<br>

### Substack
![Substack | emmysteven.com](/img/02-medium-vs-substack.webp)
[Substack](https://substack.com) is a digital platform that allows individuals to begin and grow a newsletter. Many writers are drawn to its features for paid newsletters, added social features, and coolness.

If your Substack newsletter doesn't have engaging content that readers want to share, you'll have to create a digital marketing plan to promote it when you begin writing.

  - **Medium**:
  Monetization is based on the number of people who become premium members via your referral link and the time premium members spend reading your articles.
  - **Substack**:
  You earn revenue through paid subscriptions on a monthly or yearly basis, providing a more consistent income flow compared to Medium.

- **Requirements for Monetization**
  - **Medium**:
  In order to be monetized you need a minimum of one published article, a minimum of 100 followers, and have posted at least once within the last 6 months.
  - **Substack**:
  No requirements for you to get monetized (however, they take 10% of your subscription revenue)

- **Features**
  - **Medium**:
  You have the option to create or join publications. These are shared spaces for stories focused around a common theme, usually written by multiple writers.
  - **Substack**:
  You have control over your email list, giving you the ability to view and export individual emails, a feature that Medium lacks.

- **Audience Reach**
  - **Medium**:
  Medium can be taken as a social media platform for writers. You may want to focus your attention there if you don't have an established following yet.
  - **Substack**:
  Substack doesn't provide an avenue for you to grow your audience, as only your subscribers can view your content due to its focus on email newsletters.

- **Content Focus**
  - **Medium**:
  Emphasis is placed on producing a high volume of content that can quickly gain popularity. The platform’s algorithm often favors articles that can reach a broad audience through shares and engagement, rewarding writers who can capture immediate attention.
  - **Substack**:
  Emphasis is placed on building a dedicated reader base through high-quality, thoughtful content. It prioritizes developing a loyal audience willing to subscribe and support the writer consistently.

  It acts as a launchpad for writers seeking exposure. It’s ideal for reaching a large audience quickly and is useful for testing ideas and gaining initial traction in the writing community.

## Conclusion
Medium and Substack both have their pros and cons that the other does not possess. To maximize productivity, it is important to customize your writing approach according to these strengths and limitations.

I will stress that the most effective way to decide is by experimenting with these platforms personally. While I have attempted to provide helpful information in this article, I have not taken into account your personal experience, viewpoint, and objectives. No other author who writes about this topic can do so.
